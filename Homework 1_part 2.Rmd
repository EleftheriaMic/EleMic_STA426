## log-normal sample

Let's create a sample with 100 observations from the log-normal distribution:

```{r slnorm}
slnorm<-rlnorm(100, meanlog=0, sdlog=0.25)

```

## Histogram

Let's take a look at the histogram of our previous sample:

```{r hist,eval=TRUE}
hist(slnorm, main="Histogram of a random log-normal distribution sample",xlab="observations")
```

```{r hist2,eval=TRUE}
hist(log(slnorm), main="Histogram of a random log-normal distribution sample on the log scale",xlab="log(observations)")
```

## Mean and Variance of the sample


The mean of the sample is
```{r mean,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
mean(slnorm)
```

and the variance is
```{r variance,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
var(slnorm)
```
